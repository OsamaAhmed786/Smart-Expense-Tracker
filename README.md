# Smart-Expense-Tracker
The aim of this project is to develop a Smart Expense Tracker that enables users to track their daily expenses, analyze spending patterns, and receive personalized budget optimization suggestions. 

Assessment Criteria Evaluation
1. Creativity
o The Smart Expense Tracker stands out as a practical yet innovative application.
o Unique features such as personalized budget analysis and expense warnings
demonstrate originality.
2. OOP Principles
o Encapsulation: Private attributes in the Expense class with controlled access
through getters and setters.
o Inheritance: BudgetManager extends Expense to utilize its properties and
enhance functionality.
o Polymorphism: Overriding of the toString method in Expense and usage of
dynamic behavior in methods like addExpense().
o Abstraction: The DataManager class abstracts file persistence operations, making
the core logic modular and reusable.
3. Design Quality
o A clear and complete UML class diagram illustrates relationships, inheritance
hierarchies, attributes, and methods.
4. Functionality
o The application meets all initial requirements, including expense tracking, budget
management, and persistence.
o The program is user-friendly, handles errors gracefully, and provides accurate
insights into spending.
5. Code Quality
o The code is structured, with logical separation of concerns.
o Inline comments clarify the purpose of each class and method, enhancing
readability.
